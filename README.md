<strong>VIZZable 3</strong>

Version 3 of the VIZZable suite of video plugins for Ableton Live 


Still early days here.   This will probably only be relevent for those particularly interested in where VIZZable is heading.

VIZZable 3 is being refactored - enabling the plugins to be used as bpatchers in Max and possibly later as a stand-alone application.
